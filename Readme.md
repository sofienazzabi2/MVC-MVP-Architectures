# EVAX Mobile Application

## Overview

This project aims to develop a mobile application for the EVAX platform, organized by the Tunisian Ministry of Health. The application will facilitate vaccine appointments, notifications, and other related functionalities.

## Architecture Choices

Given the time constraints of a 24-hour hackathon and the need for rapid development, we've opted for a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. MVP offers clear separation of concerns, enabling faster development cycles and easier testing. Additionally, it allows for independent development of presentation logic, making it suitable for the competitive environment of a hackathon.

## Implementation Details

### PlantUML Diagrams

Included in this repository are PlantUML diagrams illustrating the proposed architecture in both MVC and MVP styles. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the component relationships and interactions within the application.

### Refactoring Suggestions

For web and mobile applications, we recommend refactoring towards either MVC or MVP architecture, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of each platform. Both architectures provide benefits such as improved maintainability, scalability, and testability.
